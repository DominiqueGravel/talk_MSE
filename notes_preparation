Ecological networks in the anthropocene

%----------------------------------------
%---- INTRO

Thesis: we need a novel approach to measure community structure

Modeling biodiversity in the anthropocene

Original approach: species matrix

Trends in biogeography: functional diversity (Mouillot et al)

Trends in biogeography: phylogenetic diversity : Thuiller et al. 

Community ecology has a long and rich history that is so far ignored (MacArthur's book)

Objective of the talk: propose a novel approach to measure community structure building on tools of network ecology


%----------------------------------------
%---- THE SUCCESS OF THE NETWORK APPROACH 

Communities are messy: the cod food web

The start: May, Cohen, Pimm, DeAngelis and others

Second generation: Martinez

Third generation: Dunne, Sol√©, Montoya, Bascompte, 


%----------------------------------------
%---- THE SHORTCOMING: NETWORK DISTRIBUTION

Opening up the distribution of networks (potential reasons: data, history, complexity)


%----------------------------------------
%----- Revisiting the niche concept

History: two components

The issue of operationality

Different concepts for the same model: Biogeography (Pulliam)

Different concepts for the same model: The niche model for foor webs (Martinez)

Mapping ecological network (Eklof, Rohr)

Mapping niches in Eltonian and Grinnellian space


%----------------------------------------
%---- A quantitative framework for network biogeography

Framework
Analysis


%----------------------------------------
%----- Application: mapping ecological networks in the anthropocene

Infering the metaweb

Mapping the local networks in the present and the future


%----------------------------------------
%----- Conclusion
Probabilistic networks as a mean to integrate biogeography and community ecology

A new perspective to community ecology
